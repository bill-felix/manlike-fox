The following is a definition of:  Consumer Expenditure Survey (CX)

Survey Description:  The Consumer Expenditure Survey collects information from 
the Nation's households and families on their buying habits (expenditures), 
income, and characteristics. The strength of the survey is that it allows data 
users to relate the expenditures and income of consumers to the characteristics 
of those consumers. 

The survey consists of two components, a quarterly Interview Survey and a 
weekly Diary Survey, each with its own questionnaire and sample.  For the 
Diary survey, respondents complete a diary of expenses for two consecutive 
1-week periods.  The Diary survey is designed to obtain data on frequently 
purchased items, such as food or housekeeping supplies, that respondents 
are less likely to recall over time.  For the Interview survey, respondents 
report data to an interviewer.  Each sample household is interviewed once
per quarter, for five consectutive quarters.  This survey is designed to 
collect data on major items of expense, such as property purchases or
vehicle purchases, and those that occur on a regular basis, such as rent
or utility payments, that respondents recall for 3 months or longer.
 
Summary Data Available:  The following types of demographic data are available; 
average number of consumer units, percent male and female, education level, 
age and race of reference person.  Average annual expenditures consist of 
fourteen main categories:  Food, alcoholic beverages, housing, apparel 
and services, transportation, health care, entertainment, personal care 
products and services, reading, education, tobacco products and smoking 
supplies, miscellaneous, cash contributions, and personal insurance and pensions.  

Average annual expenditures, income, and characteristics 
per consumer unit are classified by 13 characteristics: quinitles of income
before taxes; income before taxes; age of reference person; size of consumer
unit; composition of consumer unit; number of earners; housing tenure and
type of area; race of reference person; Hispanic or Latino origion of 
reference person; region of residence; occupation of reference person;
education of reference person. 

Frequency of Observations:  All data are annual.

Annual Averages:  All data are based on annual averages. 

Base Periods:  Not applicable.

Data Characteristics:  Average annual expenditures are reported in dollars 
and are stored with no decimal places.  Income is reported in dollars 
and is stored with no decimal places.  Number of Consumer Units is 
reported in thousands and is stored with no decimal places. Percent 
distributions are stored with no decimal places.  Consumer unit 
characteristics are reported averages and are stored with one decimal place.

Updating Schedule:  Updates are done annually, usually in September.

The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per load)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series. 
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation.  

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
cx.series.  Note the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist in the
database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated by 
tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data 
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element		Length		Value(Example)		

 1.  series_id	 	 	14 TO 18	CXU080110LB0101M

 2.  seasonal	 	  	1		U

 3.  category_code		10		EXPEND 

 4.  subcategory_code		8		FOODTOTL 

 5.  item_code		   	4 TO 8		080110

13.  end_year		   	4		2000		

14.  end_period		   	3		A01	
					

The series_id (CXU080110LB0101M) can be broken out into:

Code					Value(Example)

survey abbreviation	=		CX
seasonal(code)		=		U
item_code		=		080110
demographics_code	=		LB01
characteristics_code	=		01
Process_code		=		M
